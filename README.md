# Treehouse FrontEnd Project06

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/As-12/Treehouse-FEWD.svg?branch=Project06)](https://travis-ci.com/As-12/Treehouse-FEWD)

## Instruction
In this project, you'll create a browser version of “Wheel of Success”, a word guessing game where players will click letters from an onscreen keyboard to try to guess a random phrase.

Using Javascript, you’ll create an array of phrases and write functions to choose a random phrase from that array, split the phrase into letters, and put those letters onto the game board.

Each time the player guesses a letter, you’ll need to compare the letter the player has chosen with the random phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, you’ll update the game board with the chosen letters.

A player can keep choosing letters until they make five incorrect guesses. If the letter they chose isn’t in the phrase, you’ll remove one of the player’s 5 guesses.

If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen will display. If the player guesses incorrectly 5 times, a losing screen will display.

A player can guess a letter only once. After they’ve guessed a letter, your programming will need to disable that letter.

## NOTE
The Front End Web Development Techdegree is meant to train you in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and let you practice and show your mastery of these fundamental building blocks of the web. Because of that, please avoid using frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, Skeleton, and so on for this project. Even though you may end up using frameworks like these professionally, you still need to know and be able to implement designs with your own knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In addition, please avoid submitting any projects that rely on a server-side technology like PHP or Ruby on Rails.
