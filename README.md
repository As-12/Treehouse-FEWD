# Treehouse FrontEnd Project05

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/As-12/Treehouse-FEWD.svg?branch=Project05)](https://travis-ci.com/As-12/Treehouse-FEWD)

## Instruction
In this project, you will create an interactive photo gallery using JavaScript and jQuery. Thumbnails and photos will be provided with descriptions. At the top of the page, you'll have a search area where photos will hide and show depending on user input. When the user clicks on a thumbnail, the photo will display in a lightbox. There should be a back and previous arrows to cycle through photos.


## NOTE
The Front End Web Development Techdegree is meant to train you in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and let you practice and show your mastery of these fundamental building blocks of the web. Because of that, please avoid using frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, Skeleton, and so on for this project. Even though you may end up using frameworks like these professionally, you still need to know and be able to implement designs with your own knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In addition, please avoid submitting any projects that rely on a server-side technology like PHP or Ruby on Rails.
