# Treehouse FrontEnd Project04

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/As-12/Treehouse-FEWD.svg?branch=Project04)](https://travis-ci.com/As-12/Treehouse-FEWD)

## Instruction
In this project, we've provided completed index.html and styles.css files. You will be responsible for converting the CSS into Sass by splitting the code into several Sass partial files. You will also look for repeated values (length units, colors, etc.) throughout the CSS and store them in Sass variables. After completing the project, you'll have a useful Sass micro-framework to quickly prototype other websites.

## NOTE
The Front End Web Development Techdegree is meant to train you in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and let you practice and show your mastery of these fundamental building blocks of the web. Because of that, please avoid using frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, Skeleton, and so on for this project. Even though you may end up using frameworks like these professionally, you still need to know and be able to implement designs with your own knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In addition, please avoid submitting any projects that rely on a server-side technology like PHP or Ruby on Rails.
